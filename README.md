# Python-Programming-Examples
I've solved few examples of Python Programming.
1. Write a function that inputs a number and prints the multiplication table of that number
2. Write a program to print twin primes less than 1000. If two consecutive odd numbers are both prime then they are known as twin primes
3. Write a program to implement these formulae of permutations and combinations. 
    Number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time: p(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!. 
    Number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time is: c(n, r) = n! / (r!*(n-r)!) = p(n,r) / r
4. Write a function that converts a decimal number to binary number
