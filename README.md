# Python-Programming-Examples
I've solved few examples of Python Programming.
1. Write a function that inputs a number and prints the multiplication table of that number.
2. Write a program to print twin primes less than 1000. If two consecutive odd numbers are both prime then they are known as twin primes.
3. Write a program to implement these formulae of permutations and combinations. 
    Number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time: p(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!. 
    Number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time is: c(n, r) = n! / (r!*(n-r)!) = p(n,r) / r
4. Write a function that converts a decimal number to binary number.
5. Write a function cubesum() that accepts an integer and returns the sum of the cubes of individual digits of that number.
    Use this function to make functions PrintArmstrong() and isArmstrong() to print Armstrong numbers and to find whether is an Armstrong number.
6. Write a function prodDigits() that inputs a number and returns the product of digits of that number.
7. Write a program which can filter odd numbers in a list by using filter function
